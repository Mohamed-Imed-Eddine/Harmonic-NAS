# Harmonic-NAS
Harmonic-NAS is a novel framework for the design of multimodal neural networks on resource-constrained devices. Harmonic-NAS employs a two-tier optimization strategy with an outer evolutionary search stage for the unimodal backbone networks and an inner differentiable search stage for the multimodal fusion network architecture. Harmonic-NAS also includes the hardware dimension in its optimization procedure by assessing the inference latency and energy consumption.
